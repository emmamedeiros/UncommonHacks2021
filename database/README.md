# Database

Our database is implemented in CockroachDB.

## Scripts

Before executing scripts:
- Create a virtual environment: `python3 -m venv .venv`
- Activate venv: `source .venv/bin/activate`.
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r REQUIREMENTS.txt`

For now, all scripts must be run in the `scripts` directory or they will not work. I know this is bad and I will fix this, but right now there are bigger concerns.
